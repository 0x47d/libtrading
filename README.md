# Libtrading

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/penberg/libtrading.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/penberg/libtrading)

Libtrading is an open source API for high-performance, low-latency trading
applications. It implements network protocols used for communicating with
exchanges, dark pools, and other trading venues. The API supports FIX,
FIX/FAST, and many proprietary protocols such as ITCH and OUCH used by NASDAQ.

## Features

* C API
* High performance, low latency
* FIX dialect support
* SystemTap/DTrace probes

### Performance

Protocol | RTT (Î¼s)
---------|---------
FAST     | 13
FIX      | 16

The following above were obtained by running Libtrading messaging
ping-pong tests on a 2-way 2.7GHz Sandy Bridge i7 CPU running Fedora 19
with Linux 3.11.6.  The processes were pinned to separate physical cores
and the numbers include time spent in the Linux TCP/IP stack.
